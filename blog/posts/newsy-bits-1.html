<h3>OUUC 2024 Summer UU Reading Fun Event - Newsy Bits & Shopping Tips #1</h3>
<h4>Posted by Susan, OUUC book sale volunteer on April 11th 2024</h4>
<p>
    Greetings fellow book lovers,
</p>
<p>
    We now have dates for both of OUUC's community book sales &#8722; so please mark your calendars, bring on the book donations, and help spread the word!
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>2024 SUURF</b>: OUUC's Summer UU Reading Fun online bookstore will be OPEN for Olympia-area shoppers from 7am Tuesday <b>JUNE 11</b> thru 10pm Sunday <b>JUNE 16</b> at <a href="http://www.books-ouuc.com">www.books-ouuc.com</a>.
        <br>
        <br>    
        While the virtual bookstore is open, you can shop and pay online, then pick up your combined purchases at OUUC the following week. This year, we also hope to offer a delivery service option if the OUUC pickup times are not convenient for you. The flat $10 charge will include all your purchases. Delivery is only available for shoppers with an Olympia-Lacey-Tumwater address and a dry spot for our volunteers to deliver your books.
